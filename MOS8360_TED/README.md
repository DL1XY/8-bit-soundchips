## General
TED 7360/8360 - Text Editing Device (jokingly "Tramiels Exit Device"). The chip provided video, sound generation hardware, DRAM refresh circuitry, interval timers and keyboard input handling.

- Commodore C16
- Commodore C116
- Commodore Plus/4

Alternate parttnumbers: 7360 (HMOS version)

The 8360 is functionally the same than the 7360 but they are manufactured with a different technology. Most machines contain a 8360.

## Channels
On each of two channels, you can choose a pitch in 1024 steps. Compared to the VIC, high notes are in tune, but the bass does not get below A2 (110 Hz). Low noise actually sounds like noise, although you may notice a pattern as it gets higher.

For both channels together, you can only choose one volume, from 0 to 8. Changing this volume, while either channel is on, produces a click; the greater the change, the louder. This allows to play unsigned PCM samples on a third channel.

Several games play only one melody with a chorus effect (using two slightly detuned channels). Very few drivers generate envelopes.
