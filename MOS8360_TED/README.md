## General
- Commodore C16
- Commodore C116
- Commodore Plus/4

## Channels
On each of two channels, you can choose a pitch in 1024 steps. Compared to the VIC, high notes are in tune, but the bass does not get below A2 (110 Hz). Low noise actually sounds like noise, although you may notice a pattern as it gets higher.

For both channels together, you can only choose one volume, from 0 to 8. Changing this volume, while either channel is on, produces a click; the greater the change, the louder. This allows to play unsigned PCM samples on a third channel.

Several games play only one melody with a chorus effect (using two slightly detuned channels). Very few drivers generate envelopes.
