# MEA8000


## General
The MEA8000 is a Speech Synthesizer chip. It contains a Voice Generator similar to that used in the SP0256 speech chip. However, unlike the SP0256, it doesn't contain a built-in microprocessor, nor built-in ROM.
The french company company TMPI (Techni-musique & parole informatique) built it in speech extensions for several 8-bit computers .
